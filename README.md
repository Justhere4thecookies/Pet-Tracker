# Pet-Tracker
Classroom Tool for Teachers to Reward Students for Good Behavior
🐾 Class Pet Tracker
Class Pet Tracker is a fun and engaging web app that motivates students by letting them adopt and grow pixel art pets! Each student earns points for hitting classroom goals and milestones, and their pets evolve visually—from baby to adult—as they progress. With each stage, pets unlock new accessories like scarves, hats, or glasses. Great for teachers who want to reward positive behavior, academic achievement, or classroom participation in a visual and meaningful way!
